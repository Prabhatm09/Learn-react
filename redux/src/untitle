-Disadvantage of useContext

--setUp of state and provider is complete.
  --we will have to write  multiple provider  
   -- even if we write everything in one context , the state itself became  complex.
   --useContext is bad for frequency update.



   context 
   -provider
   -global


   Redux
   -provider
   -global
    --managed by reducer function
    --we save it in store
   Actions
     --tells us what to managed
   reducer
     --how to manage (create/update/delete)   
     -it should always return the state

    library
    --react-Redux (lib to use redux in react)
    -redux(to manage the store)
